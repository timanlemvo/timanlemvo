# 👋 Hi, I’m Tima Nlemvo

**IT / Systems Engineer → Cloud • Security • Platform Engineering**

I’m an IT professional with **7+ years of enterprise experience** supporting and building secure, scalable systems across Windows, macOS, Linux, networking, identity, and infrastructure.  
I’m currently transitioning deeper into **Cloud Security, Platform / DevOps, and Systems Engineering** by designing and operating production-grade infrastructure in my homelab and documenting real incidents, tradeoffs, and lessons learned.

This GitHub is not a tutorial playground! It’s a **living portfolio of real systems, failures, and fixes**.

## 🧠 What I Actually Do

- 🖥️ **Operate a 3-node Proxmox cluster** running 25+ services with high-availability concepts  
- 🔐 **Design zero-trust access** using SSO, MFA, network segmentation, and VPN overlays  
- 📊 **Build full observability pipelines** (metrics, logs, alerting) for incident response  
- 🚨 **Investigate real outages** (kernel, VFIO, PCIe, networking) and write postmortems  
- ⚙️ **Automate workflows** for monitoring, alerting, and security responses  
- 🧪 **Run GPU-accelerated AI workloads** locally using passthrough and RAG pipelines  

---

## 🏗️ Current Focus Areas

- Cloud & Infrastructure Engineering  
- Cloud Security & Identity (IAM, Zero Trust)  
- Platform / DevOps Foundations  
- Networking (VLANs, routing, segmentation)  
- Linux systems & incident forensics

## 🧩 Highlighted Work

### 🔒 Security & Monitoring
- Wazuh SIEM / XDR deployment
- DNS filtering with AdGuard
- Event-driven alerting via automation workflows
- Centralized logging and metrics

### 📈 Observability
- Telegraf → InfluxDB → Grafana stack
- 10-second resolution metrics across all nodes
- Dashboards used for real incident investigations

### 🧑‍🚀 Incident Forensics
- Diagnosed a **silent Proxmox hard lockup** with *zero local logs*
- Used **external telemetry only** to identify a PCIe / GPU VFIO root cause
- Applied kernel-level mitigations and documented the full investigation

### 🧠 AI / ML Infrastructure
- GPU passthrough (VFIO / IOMMU)
- Local LLM inference and RAG pipelines
- Securely isolated AI workloads inside a broader platform

## 🎯 Where This Is Going

I’m intentionally moving from **“supporting systems” → “designing and owning platforms.”**  
This GitHub document provides real evidence of that transition: architecture, configs, failures, fixes, and trade-offs.

If you’re reviewing this for a **Cloud Engineer, Security Engineer, Platform, DevOps, or Systems role**, you’re looking at how I actually think and work — not just what I claim on a résumé.
